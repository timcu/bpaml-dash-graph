@author D Tim Cummings

Task 1: Setup environment
- Install Python 3.9 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/
  - Add python to path when installing, or know where it is for later
  - (3.6 or later should be fine, anaconda also fine)
- Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/
- Install IDE eg PyCharm Community Edition 2020.3.3 from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
- Clone repository and setup virtual environment (see readme1.md)
- git checkout challenge2  # Git > Branches... > Checkout tag or revision > challenge2


Task 2: First dash application
- See https://dash.plotly.com/layout
- Create a simple layout with a single <h1> and a single <div> element
- Run the application from the command line (python bpaml_covid_19_dash.py) or IDE (ctrl-shift-r)
- Create a branch to commit your changes
    git checkout -b mytask2attempt              # -b creates a branch. GUI: VCS > Git > Branches... > New Branch
    git commit -a -m "my task 2 solution"       # -a adds all changes before commit. GUI: Click tick in GUI
- Checkout task 3 and compare differences
    git checkout challenge3                     # check out branch called challenge3
    git diff challenge2 challenge3              # show what has changed between challenge2 and challenge3. GUI: Log
